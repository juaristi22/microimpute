# Imputing wealth from the SCF to the CPS

This notebook demonstrates how to use the `microimpute` package and specifically the `autoimpute` function to impute wealth variables from the Survey of Consumer Finances to the Current Population Survey.

The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) is a triennial survey conducted by the Federal Reserve that collects detailed information on U.S. families' balance sheets, income, and demographic characteristics, with a special focus on wealth measures. The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a monthly survey conducted by the Census Bureau that provides comprehensive data on the labor force, employment, unemployment, and demographic characteristics, but lacks detailed wealth information.

By using `microimpute`, wealth information can be transfered from the SCF to the CPS, enabling economic analyses that require both detailed labor market and wealth data.

## Loading and preparing the SCF and CPS datasets

The first step in the imputation process involves acquiring and harmonizing the two datasets. Extracting data from the SCF and the CPS, and then processing it to ensure the variables are compatible for imputation are crucial pre-processing steps for successful imputation. This involves identifying predictor variables that exist in both data sets and can meaningfully predict wealth, as well as ensuring they are named and encoded identically. 

```python 
@validate_call(config=VALIDATE_CONFIG)
def scf_url(year: int, VALID_YEARS: List[int] = VALID_YEARS) -> str:
    """Return the URL of the SCF summary microdata zip file for a year.

## Running wealth imputation with autoimpute

After harmonizing the two datasets, the `autoimpute` function from `microimpute` can be used to transfer wealth information from the SCF to the CPS. This powerful function streamlines the imputation process by automating hyperparameter tuning, method selection, validation, and application.

Behind the scenes, `autoimpute` evaluates multiple statistical approaches, including Quantile Random Forest, Ordinary Least Squares, Quantile Regression, and Statistical Matching. It performs cross-validation to determine which method most accurately captures the relationship between the predictor variables and wealth measures in the SCF data. The function then applies the best-performing method to generate synthetic wealth values for CPS households.

By enabling hyperparameter tuning, the function can optimize each method's parameters, further improving imputation accuracy. This automated approach saves considerable time and effort compared to manually testing different imputation strategies, while ensuring the selection of the most appropriate method for this specific imputation task.

```python
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

# Run the autoimpute process
imputations, imputed_data, fitted_model, method_results_df = autoimpute(
    donor_data=scf_data,
    receiver_data=cps_data,
    predictors=predictors,
    imputed_variables=imputed_variables,
    weight_col=weights[0],
    tune_hyperparameters=True,  # enable automated hyperparameter tuning
    normalize_data=True,  # normalization
    verbose=False,
)
```

## Comparing method performance

The method comparison plot below shows how different imputation methods performed across various quantiles. Lower quantile loss values indicate better performance. 

```python
# Extract the quantiles used in the evaluation
quantiles = [q for q in method_results_df.columns if isinstance(q, float)]

comparison_viz = method_comparison_results(
    data=method_results_df,
    metric_name="quantile loss",
    data_format="wide",
)
fig = comparison_viz.plot(
    title="Autoimpute method comparison",
    show_mean=True,
)
```

## Evaluating wealth imputations

To assess the imputation results, a comparison the distribution of wealth in the original SCF data with the imputed values in the CPS allow examining how well the imputation preserves important characteristics of the wealth distribution, such as its shape, central tendency, and dispersion.

Wealth distributions are typically highly skewed, with a long right tail representing a small number of households with very high net worth. A successful imputation should preserve this characteristic skewness while maintaining realistic values across the entire distribution. Examining both the raw distributions and log-transformed versions of wealth values can better capture important information for evaluation.

The logarithmic transformation provides a clearer view of the wealth distribution across its entire range. By logarithmically scaling the data, the extreme values are compressed while expanding the visibility of differences in the lower and middle portions of the distribution.

This transformation is particularly valuable for wealth data, where values can span many orders of magnitude. The plot above, shows how closely the imputed CPS wealth distribution matches the original SCF distribution in terms of shape and central tendency after the imputation performed by the QRF model. The vertical lines marking the mean and median values help gauge how these statistical properties have been preserved through the imputation process.

Comparing the wealth distributions that result from imputing from the SCF on to the CPS with four different models, we can visually recognize the different strengths and limitations of each of them. The implications of using one model instead of another for imputation will be further explored by evaluating the impact wealth imputed data has on microsimulation results.

## Wealth distributions by disposable income deciles

Lastly, to confidently say that our wealth imputations are coherent with other household characteristics, we can compare the average net worth values per disposable income decile for each of the four methods used. 

```python
income_col  = "household_net_income"
wealth_col  = "networth"          # e.g. "net_wealth"

decile_means = []

for model, df in model_results.items():
    tmp = df.copy()

    # Create 1–10 decile indicator (unweighted)
    tmp["income_decile"] = (
        pd.qcut(tmp[income_col], 10, labels=False) + 1
    )

    # Mean wealth in each decile
    out = (
        tmp.groupby("income_decile")[wealth_col]
           .mean()
           .reset_index(name="mean_wealth")
    )
    out["Model"] = model
    decile_means.append(out)

avg_df = pd.concat(decile_means, ignore_index=True)
avg_df["income_decile"] = avg_df["income_decile"].astype(int)

    },

QRF clearly presents the most consistent and plausable realtionship to disposable income, with a gradually increasing average as the deciles increase. This plot also supports the behavior observed above showing the extreme negative and positive predictions that OLS and QuantReg produce at the left and right tails, respectively, and Matching's underprediction at every decile.
